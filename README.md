# Functional FizzBuzz solution in Javascript

Originating from Jeff Atwood's "<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">Why programmers can't program blog post</a>".</p>

This has turned into quite a common Javascript interview question...

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</p>

I wasn't happy with any of the Functional Javascript solutions I found for this challenge, so this is my contribution :)
